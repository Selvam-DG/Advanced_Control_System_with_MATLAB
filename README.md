# Advanced_Control_System_Lab_using_MATLAB
#### Mastering in Mechatronics👨‍🎓 should have a task to control the system 📡 virtually/practically before handover to production.
##### MATLAB is used for by the Control Engineers to check the system model, Simulink the model and do the annalysis with results.
we as a control engineer design the state space system or Transfer functions from the system functions and check stability, controllability
In this Lab course, 
1. First an introduction to Matlab was there. In this basic Matlab opearations are carried out in Matlab.
2. Introduction to State Space systems by creating a Transfer functions as well as state space vectors using matlab functions
